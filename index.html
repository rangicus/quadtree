                The QuadTree search algorithm is a method of segmenting a data space into recursively smaller portions in order to ease search conditions. <br>
                It is mostly used for searching for objects in a given 2D space, as shown in the example. <br>
                <br>
                The above example has many objects (dots) on screen, and dots that are within a given distance of the mouse cursor will be highlighted in green. <br>
                Normally, you would have to loop through every single object and calculate it's distance from the mouse, but with QuadTree: you can simply look in nearby cells and only loop over a small fraction of the data. <br>
                <br>
                Instructions: <br>
                Mouse mouse to reveal data points. <br>
                Click to create a new data point.
